### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm TarcÃ­sio. I'm talking from Osasco, SÃ£o Paulo metropolitan area, Brazil.

I'm a software engineer and I work mostly with C++, and in the .NET platform.

With some luck you may find something of use in the mess of repos I keep here. I guess the pinned ones are the most worth checking. But anyway, be my guest and take a look arround ;)
