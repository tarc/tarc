### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm TarcÃ­sio. I'm talking from Osasco, SÃ£o Paulo metropolitan area, Brazil.

I'm a software engineer, mainly working with C++ and the .NET platform.

You may find something useful in the mess of repos I keep here. The pinned ones are the most worth checking. But anyway, be my guest and take a look around ;)
